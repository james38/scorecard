# Scorecard

## Possibility
This is an example of a way to graphically present the Scorecard data that is easier to comprehend for the layperson as opposed to requiring them to abstract away patterns from a list of numbers eg. 1, 1.1, 1.12, ... 1.83.

## Opportunity
GDP is a measure that's quite illustrative of the benefit of presenting the scorecard graphically. Specifically, for GDP, the countries are **not** centered around the mean, which highlights what's missing from reporting only the mean. The range and dispersion of the distribution is most meaningful in this case. The graphical method addresses both the indexing and presentation of the data.

Countries with GDP growth lower than the global average GDP growth over the time period are shown with red circles, and countries with GDP growth higher than the global average GDP growth are shown with green circles. The circles are transparent/filled-in to the degree that the country's GDP growth is similar/dissimilar from the global average GDP growth.

The size of the circles are proportional to the country's population. The blue line represents the global weighted average GDP over time and is sized based on the total population of the 40 countries. The transparency of the blue line is based on the variation of GDP between countries.

## Actions
### Data integrity
Environmental data spikes around 2004 and 2016</br>
Internet freedom data has some missing values or other issue?</br>
Corruption perception data is measured an order of magnitude differently after 2011</br>
Standardize the year to which the data is mapped - no ranges</br>
Can missing data be completed</br>
Are there other measures besides infant mortaility for which lower is better? Gender gap data?</br>

#### Issues with new data imports
Years for Econ Freedom?? 2001-2018 or 2002-2019</br>
Internet Freedom Changed 2013-14 to 2013</br>
Corruption Percept modified Sudan 2002 to be blank</br>
Human dev blanks for Nigeria in 2000, 2001, 2002</br>
Peace changed from 2013-14 to 2013</br>
Ecological Start at 1999 or 2000?

### Graphic Display
Show multiplicative measures logarithmically, but display actual units instead of log-value on Y-axis</br>
Suggest showing statistically significant changes with green borders if "good" and red borders if "bad", with no border if not statistically significant

### Communication
Address Tony's idea of using rate of change for statistical significance vs rate of change relative to stdev -- basically statistical significance takes into account the rate of change - you don't need to make a distinction for something that is statistically significant and has a certain rate of change, only whether it is statistically significant
